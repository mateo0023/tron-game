# tron-game
A simple two-hour game from 2019

## Game Background
One late night during winter break of 2019, with friends we challenged each other to build a copy of Tron within 2 hours. We all ended finishing within 3hrs.
I am uploading this now (without touching the code) to have as a simple sample of what I was able to do before the pandemic started.

## Notes
I gave the code a quick review and there are a lot of very obvious improvements.
* A simple one would be to create enumerators for the directions and other states, instead of integers with their meaning in the documentation. I knew about them back then but I guess I was too tired.
* I could also have put all the game logic into a separate class instead of spread through the main.
* Another would be to make constants `final`
* Loads of other optimizations and probably some unused code deletions
